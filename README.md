# Autonomous Car
Graduation project in NTI 4-Months program 

# overview 
Autonomous cars, also known as self-driving cars or driverless cars, are vehicles equipped with advanced technologies that can navigate and operate without human intervention. Autonomous cars often incorporate various ADAS features as part of their overall autonomous driving system. ADAS stands for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, which are technologies designed to improve vehicle safety, increase situational awareness, and enhance the driving experience. These systems are commonly found in modern cars and serve as a precursor or a subset of the technology used in autonomous vehicles.

# Features
 ### Lane Detection
 > These systems help prevent unintentional drifting from the lane by providing warnings or actively steering the vehicle back into the lane.

 ### Auto Parking
 > Auto parking systems, also known as automated parking assist (APA) or automatic parking systems, use sensors, cameras, and sometimes ultrasonic or radar technology to help a vehicle park itself without much direct input from the driver.
  - Parallel Parking: The system identifies a suitable parking space and controls the steering while the driver manages acceleration and braking.
  - Perpendicular Parking: This feature assists in parking the vehicle in spaces that are perpendicular to the road, like in parking lots. The system typically handles both steering and maneuvering.

 ### Avoid Collision 
 > Collision avoidance systems are designed to assist drivers in avoiding or mitigating accidents by using sensors, cameras, and other technology to monitor the vehicle's surroundings.
 ### Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): 
 >  This system automatically adjusts the vehicle's speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.

- #### RTOS
  
RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) efficiently schedules tasks in embedded systems by managing priorities and executing time-sensitive operations. These systems facilitate the creation, prioritization, and synchronization of tasks, ensuring the timely execution of critical functions. RTOSes enable seamless context switching between tasks, allowing higher-priority tasks to interrupt lower-priority ones as needed. This approach ensures deterministic behavior, meeting stringent timing constraints in applications requiring real-time responsiveness.

This is how we use RTOS, especially FreeRTOS in our Desgin:
